      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Born from heartbreak, healed by melody — The Male Swiftie Sanctuary is a place for men who feel deeply,
        love fiercely, and cry unapologetically to <em>All Too Well (10 Minute Version)</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, we redefine strength. It's not about suppressing emotion — it's about channeling it through
        Taylor's bridge sections and the soft glow of midnight confessionals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're a <strong>"Style"</strong> kind of guy, a <strong>"The Archer"</strong> soul, or a full-on
        <strong>"Exile"</strong> wanderer, you belong here. Grab your headphones, light a candle, and let's heal.
